This schematic allows to read CAN data from an Controller area network ( CAN) using STN2120 (i.e. OBD to UART interpreter IC)

This schematic contains the integeration of STN2120 , AVR (Micro-controller) and SIM39EA, M2M module.
The power circuit is designed keeping in mind the various considerations like -

Reverse Polarity Protection
Transient Voltage Suppression
Power Supply Filter.
